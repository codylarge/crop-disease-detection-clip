Corn Disease and Health Database

Healthy Corn:
Healthy corn plants exhibit vibrant green leaves, strong stalks, and well-developed ears. The leaves should be free of lesions, spots, or discoloration. Proper growth depends on adequate sunlight, water, and nutrient availability.

Indicators of Health
Dark green, turgid leaves
No spots, lesions, or wilting
Uniform plant height and growth
Strong root system and stalks

Best Practices for Maintaining Health
Crop rotation to prevent soil depletion
Proper fertilization based on soil testing
Regular irrigation and drainage management
Weed control to reduce competition
Monitoring for pests and diseases

Diseases:
Common Rust (Puccinia sorghi)
Common rust is a fungal disease affecting corn, particularly in warm, humid conditions. It spreads via airborne spores and can significantly reduce yield if severe.

Symptoms
Small, reddish-brown pustules on both upper and lower leaf surfaces
Pustules are elongated and may join together in severe infections
Leaves may yellow and die prematurely
Reduced photosynthesis and plant vigor

Prevention
Planting resistant hybrids
Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization
Rotating crops to break the fungal cycle
Reducing overhead irrigation

Treatment
Fungicide application if disease pressure is high
Removing infected plant debris post-harvest
Improving air circulation to reduce humidity

Gray Leaf Spot (Cercospora zeae-maydis)
Description
Gray Leaf Spot is a serious fungal disease that thrives in warm, humid conditions. It can cause significant yield loss by reducing the plant's photosynthetic ability.

Symptoms
Tan or gray rectangular lesions on lower leaves, expanding upward
Lesions have distinct parallel margins
Infected leaves may die prematurely
Reduced kernel fill due to impaired photosynthesis

Prevention
Planting resistant hybrids
Practicing crop rotation to reduce inoculum levels
Removing plant debris after harvest
Avoiding excessive nitrogen applications

Treatment
Application of foliar fungicides at early onset
Ensuring adequate plant spacing for airflow
Using no-till practices cautiously to avoid residue buildup

Northern Leaf Blight (Exserohilum turcicum)
Description
Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) is a fungal disease that affects corn in cool, wet conditions. It can cause major yield reductions if not managed properly.

Symptoms
Large, cigar-shaped tan lesions on leaves
Lesions start small but expand lengthwise
Severe infections may cause premature leaf death
Reduced grain fill and overall plant vigor

Prevention
Selecting resistant hybrids
Rotating crops to reduce pathogen presence
Practicing good field sanitation to remove infected debris
Avoiding dense planting to improve airflow

Treatment
Applying fungicides when conditions favor disease development
Ensuring proper nutrient management to maintain plant strength
Scout fields early and often for early detection
