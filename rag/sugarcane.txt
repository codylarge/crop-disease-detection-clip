Sugarcane Disease and Health Database

Healthy Sugarcane
Description
Healthy sugarcane plants exhibit strong, upright stalks with lush green leaves and a high sugar content. Proper field management, pest control, and irrigation are key to maintaining plant health and maximizing yield.

Indicators of Health:
Green, unblemished leaves
Firm, straight stalks with no discoloration or lesions
High sugar accumulation in mature stalks
Absence of wilting, leaf yellowing, or fungal growth

Best Practices for Maintaining Health:
Proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging
Balanced fertilization, especially nitrogen and potassium
Regular pest and disease monitoring
Proper spacing to improve air circulation
Crop rotation to prevent soil-borne infections

Bacterial Blight (Xanthomonas albilineans)
Description
Bacterial blight is a serious disease affecting sugarcane, causing leaf scalding and yield losses. It spreads through infected planting material and water splashes.

Symptoms:
White, narrow, streak-like lesions on leaves
Progressive leaf drying and wilting
Stunted plant growth and reduced tillering
Sudden leaf scalding and plant death in severe cases

Prevention:
Using disease-free planting material
Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilizer
Ensuring proper drainage to reduce water stagnation
Regular field inspections and rogueing infected plants

Treatment:
No effective chemical control; prevention is key
Destroying infected plants to prevent further spread
Using resistant sugarcane varieties
Sterilizing tools and equipment between uses

Red Rot (Colletotrichum falcatum)
Description
Red Rot is a fungal disease that severely impacts sugarcane yield and quality by rotting the internal tissues of the stalk.

Symptoms:
Red streaks inside the stalk with a foul odor
Yellowing and drying of leaves from the top downward
Hollowing of stalks and internal tissue decay
Poor sugar accumulation and weak canes

Prevention:
Planting resistant sugarcane varieties
Using healthy seed material for propagation
Removing and burning infected crop residues
Proper irrigation management to prevent excessive moisture

Treatment:
Fungicide application on seed cane before planting
Crop rotation with non-host plants
Ensuring proper field hygiene and sanitation
Avoiding mechanical injuries that allow fungal entry
